## pOLYMORPHISM ##

It is described by two words 
1. Poly : it means many.
2. Morph : It means forms.
means One thing having many forms.
Ex: Print() method used to print the many things. 

##two kinds##
1. Compile time Polymorphism: Static binding. can achieve by method overloading.
        why it call as compile time because compiler can get the idea at time of method calling itself, that which method is being called.
2. Runtime polymorphism: Dynamic binding. can get it by method overridinhg.   
      here compiler will got confuse that which method should have to call because both are having theire own body.
      so this work will be done by the interpretor.
