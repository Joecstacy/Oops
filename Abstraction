*****ABSTRACTION********
It means showing the features of the code but hiding the details.
For Ex. Google serach engine, whne we serach anything it feches the data and show us on screen but how internally things happening it never shows.
how: by using the "abstract" keyword. having two cases.
1. abstraction using the class: we can get 0%----100% abstraction by using class.
  Abstract Method: sysntax--- abstract public void method_name();
    it is an incomplete method cz method body not provided.
    we can give the implementation of the method by using the child class.
    rule: the class which contain the "abstract method" should be the abstract class.
    we cannot make the object of the abstract class because it contains incomplete method.
2. abstraction using the interface: but in case of interfaces we can only get 100% abstraction.
  rule: 1. by default all the variables inside the interface are PUBLIC STATIC FINAL kind.
        2. by default all the methods inside the interfaces are PUBLIC ABSTRACT.
  so it is quite obious that 100% abstraction will achieve.
  
code:

abstract class ISRO{
abstract public void rocket();
}
class DRDO extends ISRO{
public void rocket(){
System.out.println("Sukrayan ................");
}
public void launch(){
System.out.println("launching.............");
}
}
class C{
public static void main(String args[]){
DRDO z= new DRDO();
z.rocket();
z.launch();
}
}
}
